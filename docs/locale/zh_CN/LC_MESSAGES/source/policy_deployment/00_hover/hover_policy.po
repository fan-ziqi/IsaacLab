"This tutorial shows you an example of how to train and deploy HOVER which"
" is a whole-body control (WBC) policy for humanoid robots in the Isaac "
"Lab simulation environment. It uses the `HOVER`_ repository, which "
"provides an Isaac Lab extension for training neural whole-body control "
"policy for humanoids, as described in the `HOVER Paper`_ and `OMNIH2O "
"Paper`_ papers. For video demonstrations and more details about the "
"project, please visit the `HOVER Project Website`_ and the `OMNIH2O "
