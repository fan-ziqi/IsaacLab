"The contact sensor is designed to return the net contact force acting on a "
"given ridgid body. The sensor is written to behave as a physical object, and"
" so the \"scope\" of the contact sensor is limited to the body (or bodies) "
"that defines it. There are multiple ways to define this scope, depending on "
"your need to filter the forces coming from the contact."
msgstr ""
"接触传感器旨在返回作用于给定刚体的净接触力。该传感器被编写为表现得像一个物理物体，因此接触传感器的 \"范围\" "
"仅限于定义它的物体（或物体）。有多种方法可以定义此范围，具体取决于您需要过滤来自接触的力。"

"By default, the reported force is the total contact force, but your "
"application may only care about contact forces due to specific objects. "
"Retrieving contact forces from specific objects requires filtering, and this"
" can only be done in a \"many-to-one\" way. A multi-legged robot that needs "
"filterable contact information for its feet would require one sensor per "
"foot to be defined in the environment, but a robotic hand with contact "
"sensors on the tips of each finger can be defined with a single sensor."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，报告的力是总接触力，但您的应用可能只关心特定物体引起的接触力。从特定物体获取接触力需要过滤，并且这只能以 \"多对一\" "
"的方式完成。一个需要可过滤接触信息的多足机器人，必须在环境中为每个脚定义一个传感器，而一个在每个手指尖端具有接触传感器的机器人手可以通过一个传感器来定义。"

"We define the sensors on the feet of the robot in two different ways.  The "

"Notice that even with filtering, both sensors report the net contact force "
"acting on the foot. However, the \"force matrix\" on the right foot is zero "
"because that foot isn't in contact with the filtered body, "
"``/World/envs/env_.*/Cube``. Now, checkout the data coming from the hind "
"feet!"
msgstr ""
"请注意，即使进行了过滤，两个传感器都会报告作用在脚上的净接触力。然而，右脚上的 \"力矩阵\" 为零，因为该脚没有与过滤后的物体 "

"In this case, the contact sensor has two bodies: the left and right hind "
"feet.  When the force matrix is queried, the result is ``None`` because this"
" is a many body sensor, and presently Isaac Lab only supports \"many to "
"one\" contact force filtering. Unlike the single body contact sensor, the "
"reported force tensor has multiple entries, with each \"row\" corresponding "
"to the contact force on a single body of the sensor (matching the ordering "
"at construction)."
msgstr ""
"在这种情况下，接触传感器有两个主体: 左后脚和右后脚。当查询力矩阵时，结果为 ``None`` ，因为这是一个多主体传感器，而目前 Isaac Lab "
"仅支持 \"多对一\" 接触力过滤。与单主体接触传感器不同，报告的力张量有多个条目，每一 \"行\" "
"对应传感器单个主体上的接触力（与构造时的顺序匹配）。"
