"Every sensor in Isaac Lab inherits from the ``SensorBase`` abstract class"
" that provides the core functionality inherent to all sensors, which is "
"to provide access to \"measurements\" of the scene. These measurements "
"can take many forms such as ray-casting results, camera rendered images, "
"or even simply ground truth data queried directly from the simulation "
"(such as poses). Whatever the data may be, we can think of the sensor as "
"having a buffer that is periodically updated with measurements by "
"querying the scene. This ``update_period`` is defined in \"simulated\" "
"seconds, meaning that even if the flow of time in the simulation is "
"dilated relative to the real world, the sensor will update at the "
"appropriate rate. The ``SensorBase`` is also designed with "
"vectorizability in mind, holding the buffers for all copies of the sensor"
" across cloned environments."

"Updating the buffers is done by overriding the ``_update_buffers_impl`` "
"abstract method of the ``SensorBase`` class. On every time-step of the "
"simulation, ``dt``, all sensors are queried for an update. During this "
"query, the total time since the last update is incremented by ``dt`` for "
"every buffer managed by that particular sensor. If the total time is "
"greater than or equal to the ``update_period`` for a buffer, then that "
"buffer is flagged to be updated on the next query."
