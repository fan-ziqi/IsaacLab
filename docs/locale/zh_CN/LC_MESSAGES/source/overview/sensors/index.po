"Every sensor in Isaac Lab inherits from the ``SensorBase`` abstract class "
"that provides the core functionality inherent to all sensors, which is to "
"provide access to \"measurements\" of the scene. These measurements can take"
" many forms such as ray-casting results, camera rendered images, or even "
"simply ground truth data queried directly from the simulation (such as "
"poses). Whatever the data may be, we can think of the sensor as having a "
"buffer that is periodically updated with measurements by querying the scene."
" This ``update_period`` is defined in \"simulated\" seconds, meaning that "
"even if the flow of time in the simulation is dilated relative to the real "
"world, the sensor will update at the appropriate rate. The ``SensorBase`` is"
" also designed with vectorizability in mind, holding the buffers for all "
"copies of the sensor across cloned environments."
msgstr ""
"每个传感器在 Isaac Lab 中都继承自 ``SensorBase`` 抽象类，该类提供了所有传感器固有的核心功能，即提供对场景的 \"测量\" "
"数据的访问。这些测量数据可以有多种形式，如光线投射结果、相机渲染的图像，甚至是直接从仿真中查询的真实数据（例如位姿）。无论数据是什么，我们可以认为传感器具有一个缓冲区，该缓冲区通过查询场景定期更新测量数据。这个"
" ``update_period`` 是以 \"模拟\" "
"秒为单位定义的，这意味着即使仿真中的时间流逝相对于现实世界有所延迟，传感器也会以适当的速率更新。``SensorBase`` "
"还考虑到了向量化的设计，持有所有传感器在克隆环境中的副本的缓冲区。"

msgid ""
"Updating the buffers is done by overriding the ``_update_buffers_impl`` "
"abstract method of the ``SensorBase`` class. On every time-step of the "
"simulation, ``dt``, all sensors are queried for an update. During this "
"query, the total time since the last update is incremented by ``dt`` for "
"every buffer managed by that particular sensor. If the total time is greater"
" than or equal to the ``update_period`` for a buffer, then that buffer is "
"flagged to be updated on the next query."
msgstr ""
"更新缓冲区是通过重写 ``_update_buffers_impl`` 抽象方法来完成的，该方法属于 ``SensorBase`` "
"类。在每个仿真时间步长 ``dt`` 中，所有传感器都会被查询以获取更新。在此查询过程中，每个由该传感器管理的缓冲区的总时间会通过 ``dt`` "
"递增。如果总时间大于或等于某个缓冲区的 ``update_period``，则该缓冲区会被标记为在下次查询时更新。"
