"Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are a type of sensor for measuring the "
"acceleration of an object.  These sensors are traditionally designed "
"report linear accelerations and angular velocities, and function on "
"similar principles to that of a digital scale: They report accelerations "
"derived from **net force acting on the sensor**."

"A naive implementation of an IMU would report a negative acceleration due"
" to gravity while the sensor is at rest in some local gravitational "
"field. This is not generally needed for most practical applications, and "
"so most real IMU sensors often include a **gravity bias** and assume that"
" the device is operating on the surface of the Earth.  The IMU we provide"
" in Isaac Lab includes a similar bias term, which defaults to +g.  This "
"means that if you add an IMU to your simulation, and do not change this "
"bias term, you will detect an acceleration of :math:`+ 9.81 m/s^{2}` "
"anti-parallel to gravity acceleration."

"Notice that the right front foot explicitly has a bias of (0,0,0).  In "
"the visualization, you should see that the arrow indicating the "
"acceleration from the right IMU rapidly changes over time, while the "
"arrow visualizing the left IMU points constantly along the vertical axis."

"The oscillations in the values reported by the sensor are a direct result"
" of of how the sensor calculates the acceleration, which is through a "
"finite difference approximation between adjacent ground truth velocity "
"values as reported by the sim.  We can see this in the reported result "
"(pay attention to the **linear acceleration**) because the acceleration "
"from the right foot is small, but explicitly zero."
