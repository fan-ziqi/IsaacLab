"The following walkthrough will guide you through setting up an Isaac Lab "
"extension project, adding a new robot to lab, designing an environment, and "
"training a policy for that robot. For this walkthrough, we will be starting "
"with the Jetbot, a simple two wheeled differential base robot with a camera "
"mounted on top, but the intent is for these guides to be general enough that"
" you can use them to add your own robots and environments to Isaac Lab!"
