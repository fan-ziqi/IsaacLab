"Assets used in Isaac Lab are hosted on AWS S3 buckets on the cloud. Asset"

"Prior to Isaac Sim 4.5, assets were accessible from the Omniverse Nucleus"
" server and through setting up a local Nucleus server. Although from "
"Isaac Sim 4.5, we have deprecated the use of Omniverse Nucleus and the "
"Omniverse Launcher, any existing instances or setups of local Nucleus "
"instances should still work. We recommend keeping existing setups if a "
"local Nucleus server was previously already set up."
