"Despite the success of Isaac Gym, it is not designed to be a general purpose"
" simulator for robotics. For example, it does not include interaction "

"showcase the capabilities of the underlying physics engine. With the release"
" of `Isaac Sim`_, NVIDIA is building a general purpose simulator for "

"Isaac Lab is built on top of Isaac Sim to provide a unified and flexible "
"framework for robot learning that exploits latest simulation technologies. "
"It is designed to be modular and extensible, and aims to simplify common "
"workflows in robotics research (such as RL, learning from demonstrations, "
"and motion planning). While it includes some pre-built environments, "
"sensors, and tasks, its main goal is to provide an open-sourced, unified, "
"and easy-to-use interface for developing and testing custom environments and"
" robot learning algorithms. It not only inherits the capabilities of Isaac "
"Sim, but also adds a number of new features that pertain to robot learning "
"research. For example, including actuator dynamics in the simulation, "
"procedural terrain generation, and support to collect data from human "
"demonstrations."

"Since Isaac Sim remains closed-sourced, it is difficult for users to "
"contribute to the simulator and build a common framework for research. On "
"its current path, we see the community using the simulator will simply "
"develop their own frameworks that will result in scattered efforts with a "
"lot of duplication of work. This has happened in the past with other "
"simulators, and we believe that it is not the best way to move forward as a "
"community."
msgstr ""
"由于Isaac "
"Sim仍然是闭源的，用户很难为模拟器做出贡献并构建一个共同的研究框架。在当前的道路上，我们看到使用模拟器的社区将仅开发自己的框架，这将导致分散的努力和大量重复的工作。这在过去的其他模拟器中已经发生过，我们认为这不是社区向前发展的最佳方式。"

"Isaac Lab provides an open-sourced platform for the community to drive "
"progress with consolidated efforts toward designing benchmarks and robot "
"learning systems as a joint initiative. This allows us to reuse existing "
"components and algorithms, and to build on top of each other's work. Doing "
"so not only saves time and effort, but also allows us to focus on the more "
"important aspects of research. Our hope with Isaac Lab is that it becomes "
"the de-facto platform for robot learning research and an environment *zoo* "
"that leverages Isaac Sim. As the framework matures, we foresee it "
"benefitting hugely from the latest simulation developments (as part of "
"internal developments at NVIDIA and collaborating partners) and research in "
"robotics."
