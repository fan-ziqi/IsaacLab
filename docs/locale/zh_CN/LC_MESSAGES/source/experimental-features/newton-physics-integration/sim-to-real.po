"Deploying policies from simulation to real robots involves important nuances"
" that must be addressed. This section provides a high-level guide for "
"training policies that can be deployed on a real Unitree G1 robot. The key "
"challenge is that not all observations available in simulation can be "
"directly measured by real robot sensors. This means RL-trained policies "
"cannot be directly deployed unless they use only sensor-available "
"observations. For example, while real robot IMU sensors provide angular "
"acceleration (which can be integrated to get angular velocity), they cannot "
"directly measure linear velocity. Therefore, if a policy relies on base "
"linear velocity during training, this information must be removed before "
"real robot deployment."
msgstr ""
"从模拟到真实的机器人部署策略涉及必须解决的重要细微差别。本节提供了一个针对真实Unitree "
"G1机器人部署训练策略的高级指南。关键挑战在于并非所有模拟中可用的observations都可以通过真实机器人传感器直接测量。这意味着经过RL训练的策略在没有使用仅传感器可用的observations时不能直接部署。例如，虽然真实机器人的IMU传感器提供了角加速度（可以被积分以获得角速度），但它们不能直接测量线速度。因此，如果一个策略在训练期间依赖基本线速度，那么在真实机器人部署之前必须将该信息删除。"
