"IsaacLab 3.0 is the upcoming release of IsaacLab, which will be "
"compatible with Isaac Sim 6.0, and at the same time will support the new "
"Newton physics engine. This will allow users to train policies on the "
"Newton physics engine, or PhysX. To accommodate this major code "
"refactoring are required. In this section, we will go over some of the "
"changes, how that will affect IsaacLab 2.X users, and how to migrate to "
"IsaacLab 3.0. The current branch of ``feature/newton`` gives a glance of "
"what is to come. While the changes to the internal code structure are "
"significant, the changes to the user API are minimal."
msgstr "IsaacLab 3.0是IsaacLab即将发布的版本，它将与Isaac Sim 6.0兼容，同时支持新的Newton物理引擎。这将允许用户在Newton物理引擎或PhysX上训练策略。为了适应这一重大变化，需要进行代码重构。在本节中，我们将介绍一些变化、这将如何影响IsaacLab 2.X用户，以及如何迁移到IsaacLab 3.0。当前的 ``feature/newton`` 分支展示了即将到来的内容。虽然内部代码结构的变化很大，但用户API的变化很小。"

"Let's start with the biggest change: enabling the use of multiple physics"
" engines. We refactored our code so that we can not only support PhysX "
"and Newton, but any other physics engine, enabling users to bring their "
"own physics engine to IsaacLab if they desire. To enable this, we "
"introduce a base implementations of our ``simulation interfaces``, "
":class:`~isaaclab.assets.articulation.Articulation` or "
":class:`~isaaclab.sensors.ContactSensor` for instance. These provide a "
"set of abstract methods that all physics engines must implement. In turn "
"this allows all of the default IsaacLab environments to work with any "
"physics engine. This also allows us to ensure that IsaacLab 3.0 is "
"backwards compatible with IsaacLab 2.X. For engine specific calls, users "
"could get the underlying view of the physics engine and call the engine "
"specific APIs directly."
msgstr "让我们从最大的变化开始：启用多个物理引擎的使用。我们重构了代码，使其不仅可以支持PhysX和Newton，还可以支持任何其他物理引擎，使用户可以根据需要将自己的物理引擎引入IsaacLab。为了实现这一点，我们引入了 ``仿真接口`` 的基础实现，例如 :class:`~isaaclab.assets.articulation.Articulation` 或 :class:`~isaaclab.sensors.ContactSensor` 。这些提供了所有物理引擎必须实现的一组抽象方法。反过来，这允许所有默认的IsaacLab环境与任何物理引擎一起工作。这也确保了IsaacLab 3.0向后兼容IsaacLab 2.X。对于特定引擎的调用，用户可以获取物理引擎的底层视图并直接调用特定引擎的API。"

"However, as we are refactoring the code, we are also looking at ways to "
"limit the overhead of IsaacLab's. In an effort to minimize the overhead, "
"we are moving all our low level code away from torch, and instead will "
"rely heavily on warp. This will allow us to write low level code that is "
"more efficient, and also to take advantage of the cuda-graphing. However,"
" this means that the ``data classes`` such as "
":class:`~isaaclab.assets.articulation.ArticulationData` or "
":class:`~isaaclab.sensors.ContactSensorData` will only return warp "
"arrays. Users will hence have to call ``wp.to_torch`` to convert them to "
"torch tensors if they desire. Our setters/writers will support both warp "
"arrays and torch tensors, and will use the most optimal strategy to "
"update the warp arrays under the hood. This minimizes the amount of "
"changes required for users to migrate to IsaacLab 3.0."
msgstr "然而，在重构代码的同时，我们也在寻找限制IsaacLab开销的方法。为了最小化开销，我们将所有底层代码从torch转移出来，改为大量依赖warp。这将使我们能够编写更高效的底层代码，并利用CUDA图形化。然而，这意味着 ``数据类`` （如 :class:`~isaaclab.assets.articulation.ArticulationData` 或 :class:`~isaaclab.sensors.ContactSensorData` ）将只返回warp数组。因此，如果需要，用户必须调用 ``wp.to_torch`` 将其转换为torch张量。我们的setters/writers将同时支持warp数组和torch张量，并将使用最优策略在底层更新warp数组。这最小化了用户迁移到IsaacLab 3.0所需的更改量。"

"Another new feature of the writers and setters is the ability to provide "
"them with masks and complete data (as opposed to indices and partial data"
" in IsaacLab 2.X). Note that this feature will be available along with "
"the ability to provide indices and partial data, and that the default "
"behavior will still be to provide indices and partial data. However, if "
"using warp, users will have to provide masks and complete data. In "
"general we encourage users to move to adopt this new feature as, if done "
"well, it will reduce on the fly memory allocations, and should result in "
"better performance."
msgstr "writers和setters的另一个新功能是能够向它们提供掩码和完整数据（与IsaacLab 2.X中的索引和部分数据相对）。请注意，此功能将与提供索引和部分数据的能力一起提供，默认行为仍将是提供索引和部分数据。但是，如果使用warp，用户将必须提供掩码和完整数据。一般来说，我们鼓励用户采用这一新功能，因为如果做得好，它将减少即时内存分配，并应该带来更好的性能。"

"On the optimization front, we decided to change quaternion conventions. "
"Originally, IsaacLab and Isaac Sim both adopted the ``wxyz`` convention. "
"However, we were doing a located of conversion to and from ``xyzw`` in "
"our setters/writers as PhysX uses the ``xyzw`` convention. Since both "
"Newton and Warp, also use the ``xyzw`` convention, we decided to change "
"our default convention to ``xyzw``. This means that all our APIs will now"
" return quaternions in the ``xyzw`` convention. This is likely a breaking"
" change for all the custom mdps that are not using our "
":mod:`~isaaclab.utils.math` module. While this change is substantial, it "
"should make things more consistent for when users are using the "
"simulation views directly, and will remove needless conversions."
msgstr "在优化方面，我们决定更改四元数约定。最初，IsaacLab和Isaac Sim都采用了 ``wxyz`` 约定。然而，由于PhysX使用 ``xyzw`` 约定，我们在setters/writers中进行了大量的 ``xyzw`` 转换。由于Newton和Warp也使用 ``xyzw`` 约定，我们决定将默认约定更改为 ``xyzw`` 。这意味着我们所有的API现在都将以 ``xyzw`` 约定返回四元数。对于所有未使用我们 :mod:`~isaaclab.utils.math` 模块的自定义mdp，这可能是一个破坏性更改。虽然这个变化很大，但当用户直接使用仿真视图时，它应该使事情更加一致，并将消除不必要的转换。"

"Finally, alongside the new isaaclab_newton extension, we are also "
"introducing new isaaclab_experimental and isaaclab_task_experimental "
"extensions. These extensions will allow quickly bring to main isaaclab "
"new features while leaving them the time they need to mature before being"
" fully integrated into the core isaaclab extensions. In this release, we "
"are introducing cuda-graphing support for direct rl tasks. This allows to"
" drastically reduce IsaacLab's overhead making training faster. Try them "
"out and let us know what you think!"
msgstr "最后，除了新的isaaclab_newton扩展之外，我们还引入了新的isaaclab_experimental和isaaclab_task_experimental扩展。这些扩展将允许快速将新功能引入主isaaclab，同时给它们足够的时间成熟，然后再完全集成到核心isaaclab扩展中。在此版本中，我们为直接RL任务引入了CUDA图形化支持。这可以大幅减少IsaacLab的开销，使训练更快。试试它们，让我们知道您的想法！"
