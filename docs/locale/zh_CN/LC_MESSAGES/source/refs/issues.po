msgid ""
"When resetting the environment, some of the data fields of assets and "
"sensors are not updated. These include the poses of links in a kinematic "
"chain, the camera images, the contact sensor readings, and the lidar point "
"clouds. This is a known issue which has to do with the way the PhysX and "
"rendering engines work in Omniverse."
msgstr ""
"重置环境时，某些资产和传感器的数据字段未更新。这些包括关节链中链接的姿势、摄像头图像、接触传感器读数和激光雷达点云。这是一个已知问题，与 "
"Omniverse 中 PhysX 和渲染引擎的工作方式有关。"

"Many physics engines do a simulation step as a two-level call: ``forward()``"
" and ``simulate()``, where the kinematic and dynamic states are updated, "
"respectively. Unfortunately, PhysX has only a single ``step()`` call where "
"the two operations are combined. Due to computations through GPU kernels, it"
" is not so straightforward for them to split these operations. Thus, at the "
"moment, it is not possible to set the root and/or joint states and do a "
"forward call to update the kinematic states of links. This affects both "
"initialization as well as episodic resets."
msgstr ""
"许多物理引擎将模拟步骤作为两级调用处理： ``forward()`` 和 ``simulate()`` "
"，分别更新关节链中的运动学和动态状态。不幸的是，PhysX 只有一个 ``step()`` 调用，其中两个操作合并起来。由于通过 GPU "
"内核计算，它们无法简单地将这些操作拆分开来。因此，目前无法设置根和/或关节状态并进行向前调用以更新链接的运动学状态。这既影响初始化，也影响周期性重置。"

#: ../../source/refs/issues.rst:23
msgid ""
"Similarly for RTX rendering related sensors (such as cameras), the sensor "
"data is not updated immediately after setting the state of the sensor. The "
"rendering engine update is bundled with the simulator's ``step()`` call "
"which only gets called when the simulation is stepped forward. This means "
"that the sensor data is not updated immediately after a reset and it will "
"hold outdated values."
msgstr ""
"对于与 RTX 渲染相关的传感器（如摄像头），在设置传感器状态后，传感器数据不会立即更新。渲染引擎更新与模拟器的 ``step()`` "
"调用捆绑在一起，仅在模拟向前步进时才会调用。这意味着传感器数据在重置后不会立即更新，它将保留过时的值。"

"While the above is erroneous, there is currently no direct workaround for "
"it. From our experience in using IsaacGym, the reset values affect the agent"
" learning critically depending on how frequently the environment terminates."
" Eventually if the agent is learning successfully, this number drops and "
"does not affect the performance that critically."
msgstr ""
"虽然上述是错误的，但目前没有直接的解决方法。根据我们在使用 IsaacGym "
"时的经验，重置值对代理学习的影响取决于环境终止的频率。如果代理成功学习，这个数字会下降并且不会对性能有显著影响。"

msgid ""
"Due to GPU work scheduling, there's a possibility that runtime changes to "
"simulation parameters may alter the order in which operations take place. "
"This occurs because environment updates can happen while the GPU is occupied"
" with other tasks. Due to the inherent nature of floating-point numeric "
"storage, any modification to the execution ordering can result in minor "
"changes in the least significant bits of output data. These changes may lead"
" to divergent execution over the course of simulating thousands of "
"environments and simulation frames."
msgstr ""
"由于 GPU 工作调度，运行时对仿真参数的更改有可能改变操作执行顺序。这是因为当 GPU "
"忙于其他任务时，环境更新可能会发生。由于浮点数存储的固有性质，对执行顺序的任何修改可能会导致输出数据中最不重要的位的微小变化。这些变化可能会导致在模拟数千个环境和仿真帧的过程中执行发散。"

msgid ""
"An illustrative example of this issue is observed with the runtime domain "
"randomization of object's physics materials. This process can introduce both"
" determinancy and simulation issues when executed on the GPU due to the way "
"these parameters are passed from the CPU to the GPU in the lower-level APIs."
" Consequently, it is strongly advised to perform this operation only at "
"setup time, before the environment stepping commences."
msgstr ""
"此问题的一个示例是观察对象物理材料的运行时域随机化。由于这些参数是通过低级 API 从 CPU 传递到 GPU "
"的方式，这个过程可能会导致确定性和仿真问题，因此强烈建议仅在设置时间执行此操作，然后才开始环境步进。"

"In addition, due to floating point precision, states across different "
"environments in the simulation may be non-deterministic when the same set of"
" actions are applied to the same initial states. This occurs as environments"
" are placed further apart from the world origin at (0, 0, 0). As actors get "
"placed at different origins in the world, floating point errors may build up"
" and result in slight variance in results even when starting from the same "
"initial states. One possible workaround for this issue is to place all "
"actors/environments at the world origin at (0, 0, 0) and filter out "
"collisions between the environments. Note that this may induce a performance"
" degradation of around 15-50%, depending on the complexity of actors and "
"environment."
msgstr ""
"此外，由于浮点精度的原因，在仿真中不同环境中的状态在应用相同的一组动作到相同的初始状态时可能是非确定性的。这是因为环境被放置在世界原点 (0, 0, "
"0) "
"附近。由于演员被放置在世界中不同的原点，浮点错误可能会积累，并导致结果略有不同，即使从相同的初始状态开始。这个问题的一个可能解决方法是将所有演员/环境放置在世界原点"
" (0, 0, 0) 并且过滤掉环境之间的碰撞。请注意，这可能会导致性能下降约15-50%，具体取决于演员和环境的复杂性。"
