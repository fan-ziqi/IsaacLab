msgid ""
"When resetting the environment, some of the data fields of assets and "
"sensors are not updated. These include the poses of links in a kinematic "
"chain, the camera images, the contact sensor readings, and the lidar "
"point clouds. This is a known issue which has to do with the way the "
"PhysX and rendering engines work in Omniverse."
msgstr ""
"重置环境时，某些资产和传感器的数据字段未更新。这些包括关节链中链接的姿势、相机图像、接触传感器读数和激光雷达点云。这是一个已知问题，与 "
"Omniverse 中 PhysX 和渲染引擎的工作方式有关。"

#: ../../source/refs/issues.rst:16
msgid ""
"Many physics engines do a simulation step as a two-level call: "
"``forward()`` and ``simulate()``, where the kinematic and dynamic states "
"are updated, respectively. Unfortunately, PhysX has only a single "
"``step()`` call where the two operations are combined. Due to "
"computations through GPU kernels, it is not so straightforward for them "
"to split these operations. Thus, at the moment, it is not possible to set"
" the root and/or joint states and do a forward call to update the "
"kinematic states of links. This affects both initialization as well as "
"episodic resets."
msgstr ""
"许多物理引擎将仿真步骤作为两级调用处理:``forward()`` 和 ``simulate()`` "
"，分别更新关节链中的运动学和动态状态。不幸的是，PhysX 只有一个 ``step()`` 调用，其中两个操作合并起来。由于通过 GPU "
"内核计算，它们无法简单地将这些操作拆分开来。因此，目前无法设置根和/或关节状态并进行向前调用以更新链接的运动学状态。这既影响初始化，也影响周期性重置。"

#: ../../source/refs/issues.rst:23
msgid ""
"Similarly for RTX rendering related sensors (such as cameras), the sensor"
" data is not updated immediately after setting the state of the sensor. "
"The rendering engine update is bundled with the simulator's ``step()`` "
"call which only gets called when the simulation is stepped forward. This "
"means that the sensor data is not updated immediately after a reset and "
"it will hold outdated values."
msgstr ""
"对于与 RTX 渲染相关的传感器（如相机），在设置传感器状态后，传感器数据不会立即更新。渲染引擎更新与仿真器的 ``step()`` "
"调用捆绑在一起，仅在仿真向前步进时才会调用。这意味着传感器数据在重置后不会立即更新，它将保留过时的值。"

"While the above is erroneous, there is currently no direct workaround for"
" it. From our experience in using IsaacGym, the reset values affect the "
"agent learning critically depending on how frequently the environment "
"terminates. Eventually if the agent is learning successfully, this number"
" drops and does not affect the performance that critically."
msgstr ""
"虽然上述是错误的，但目前没有直接的解决方法。根据我们在使用 IsaacGym "
"时的经验，重置值对智能体学习的影响取决于环境终止的频率。如果智能体成功学习，这个数字会下降并且不会对性能有显著影响。"

"With Isaac Lab 1.2, we have introduced a PhysX kinematic update call "
"inside the :attr:`~isaaclab.assets.ArticulationData.body_state_w` "

"updated when the root state or joint state of an articulation is set."
msgstr ""
"使用 Isaac Lab 1.2，我们在 "
":attr:`~isaaclab.assets.ArticulationData.body_state_w` 属性内引入了 PhysX "
"运动学更新调用。 这种解决方法确保了当设置了root或关节的状态时，连杆的状态也会得到更新。"

msgid ""
"When using `instanceable assets`_ for markers, the markers do not work "

"will hopefully be fixed in a future release."

#: ../../source/refs/issues.rst:73
msgid ""
"If you use an instanceable assets for markers, the marker class removes "
"all the physics properties of the asset. This is then replicated across "

"not in its stage reference's USD file."

"如果使用实例化资产作为标记对象，则标记对象类会删除资产的所有物理属性。这会在相同资产的其他引用上复制，因为实例化资产的物理属性存储在实例化资产的 "

msgid ""
"Starting with Isaac Sim 5.1, links connected through ``fixed_joint`` "
"elements are no longer merged when their URDF link entries specify mass "
"and inertia even if ``merge-joint`` set to True. This is expected "
"behaviour—those links are treated as full bodies rather than zero-mass "
"reference frames. However, the USD importer currently raises "
"``ReportError`` warnings showing unresolved references for such links "
"when they lack visuals or colliders. This is a known bug in the importer;"
" it creates references to visuals that do not exist. The warnings can be "
"safely ignored until the importer is updated."
msgstr "从 Isaac Sim 5.1 开始，即使 ``merge-joint`` 设置为 True，当 URDF 链接条目指定质量和惯性时，通过 ``fixed_joint`` 元素连接的链接不再合并。这是预期行为——这些链接被视为完整的刚体而不是零质量参考框架。但是，USD 导入器目前会引发 ``ReportError`` 警告，显示此类链接在缺少视觉或碰撞器时的未解析引用。这是导入器中的已知错误；它创建了对不存在的视觉的引用。在导入器更新之前，可以安全地忽略这些警告。"

"In Isaac Sim 5.0, we have observed some workflows exiting with an "
"``OSError`` indicating ``version 'GLIBCXX_3.4.30' not found`` when "
"running from a conda environment. The issue apperas to be stemming from "
"importing torch or torch-related packages, such as tensorboard, prior to "
"launching ``AppLauncher``. As a workaround, ensure that all torch imports"
" happen after the ``AppLauncher`` instance has been created, which should"
" resolve the error."
msgstr ""
"在 Isaac Sim 5.0 中，我们注意到一些工作流在从 conda 环境运行时会出现 ``OSError`` 提示 ``version "
"'GLIBCXX_3.4.30' not found`` 的问题。该问题似乎是因为在启动 ``AppLauncher`` 之前导入 torch "
"或与 torch 相关的软件包（如 tensorboard）导致的。作为解决方法，请确保所有的 torch 导入发生在创建 "
"``AppLauncher`` 实例之后，这样应该可以解决错误。"
