"This release introduces the official support for teleoperation using the "
"Apple Vision Pro for collecting high-quality and dexterous hand data, "
"including the addition of bi-manual teleoperation and imitation learning "
"workflows through Isaac Lab Mimic."
msgstr ""

"We have also introduced new randomization methods for USD attributes, "
"including the randomization of scale, color, and textures. In this "
"release, we updated RSL RL to v2.3.1, which introduces many additional "
"features including distributed training, student-teacher distillation, "
"and recurrent student-teacher distillation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, we revamped the `Extension Template <https://github.com"
"/isaac-sim/IsaacLabExtensionTemplate>`_ to include an automatic template "
"generator tool from within the Isaac Lab repo. The extension template is "
"a powerful method for users to develop new projects in user-hosted repos,"
" allowing for isolation from the core Isaac Lab repo and changes. The "
"previous IsaacLabExtensionTemplate repo showed a limited example "
"pertaining only to the Manager-based workflow and RSL RL. In the new "
"template generator, users can choose from any supported workflow and RL "
"library, along with the desired RL algorithm. We will be deprecating the "
"standalone `IsaacLabExtensionTemplate <https://github.com/isaac-"
"sim/IsaacLabExtensionTemplate>`_ in the near future."

"NVIDIA has also released `HOVER <https://github.com/NVlabs/HOVER>`_ as an"
" independent repo, hosting a neural whole body controller for humanoids "
"built on top of Isaac Lab. HOVER includes sim-to-real workflows for "
"deployment on the Unitree H1 robot, which we have also added a tutorial "
"guide for the deployment process in the Isaac Lab documentation."

"Previously, the flag ``disable_contact_processing`` led to confusion "
