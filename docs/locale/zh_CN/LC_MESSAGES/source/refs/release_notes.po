msgid ""
"The Isaac Lab 2.3.0 release, built on Isaac Sim 5.1, delivers "
"enhancements across dexterous manipulation, teleoperation, and learning "
"workflows. It introduces new dexterous environments with advanced "
"training capabilities, expands surface gripper and teleoperation support "
"for a wider range of robots and devices, and integrates SkillGen with the"
" Mimic imitation learning pipeline to enable GPU-accelerated motion "
"planning and skill-based data generation with cuRobo integration."

#: ../../source/refs/release_notes.rst:21
msgid ""
"**Dexterous RL (DexSuite)**:  Introduction of two new dexterous "
"manipulation environments using the Kuka arm and Allegro hand setup, with"
" addition of support for Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR) and PBT "
"(Population-Based Training)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/refs/release_notes.rst:23
msgid ""
"**Surface gripper updates**: Surface gripper has been extended to support"
" Manager-based workflows, including the addition of "
"``SurfaceGripperAction`` and ``SurfaceGripperActionCfg``, along with "
"several new environments demonstrating teleoperation examples with "
"surface grippers and the RMPFlow controller. New robots and variations "
"are introduced, including Franka and UR10 with robotiq grippers and "
"suction cups, and Galbot and Agibot robots."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/refs/release_notes.rst:28
msgid ""
"**Mimic - SkillGen**: SkillGen support has been added for the Mimic "
"Imitation Learning pipeline, introducing cuRobo integration, integrating "
"GPU motion planning with skill-segmented data generation. Note that "
"cuRobo has proprietary licensing terms, please review the `cuRobo license"
" <https://github.com/isaac-"

#: ../../source/refs/release_notes.rst:33
msgid ""
"**Mimic - Locomanipulation**: Added a new G1 humanoid environment "
"combining RL-based locomotion with IK-based manipulation. A full robot "
"navigation stack is integrated to augment demonstrations with "
"randomization of tabletop pick/place locations, destination and ground "
"obstacles. By segmenting tasks into pick-navigate-place phases, this "
"method enables generation of large-scale loco-manipulation datasets from "
"manipulation-only demonstrations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/refs/release_notes.rst:38
msgid ""
"**Teleoperation**: Upper body inverse kinematics controller is improved "
"by adding a null space posture task that helps enable waist movement on "
"humanoid tasks while regularizing redundant degrees-of-freedom to a "
"preferred upright posture. Additionally, support for Vive and Manus Glove"
" are introduced, providing more options for teleoperation devices."
