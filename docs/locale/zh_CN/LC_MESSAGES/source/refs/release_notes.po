"Isaac Lab 2.0 brings some exciting new features, including a new addition"
" to the Imitation Learning workflow with the **Isaac Lab Mimic** "
"extension. Isaac Lab Mimic provides the ability to automatically generate"
" additional trajectories based on just a few human collected "
"demonstrations, allowing for larger training datasets with less human "
"effort. This work is based on the `MimicGenv "
"<https://mimicgen.github.io/>`_ work for Scalable Robot Learning using "
"Human Demonstrations."
